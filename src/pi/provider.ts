/**
 * Match-state extraction — the autocomplete decision gate (PRD §07,
 * P1.M3.T3.S1). For one cursor position this decides HOW hapax offers
 * suggestions, or whether it offers any at all:
 *
 *   1. trigger mode — the configured trigger char (default "#") at
 *      line start or after a space/tab, followed by an optional
 *      fragment containing no whitespace and no further trigger
 *      chars; zero-length fragments count (a bare "#" matches).
 *   2. threshold mode — a trailing identifier
 *      ([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*) whose length reaches config.threshold;
 *      fires EVERYWHERE, any word start, no position gating.
 *   3. null — neither matched: the caller (S2's getSuggestions) must
 *      return pi's built-in completion untouched so path/slash
 *      completion keeps working exactly as before (never-hijack
 *      rules). Trigger mode wins over threshold mode.
 *
 * `prefix` is the exact text pi-tui's applyCompletion replaces on
 * acceptance: triggerChar + fragment in trigger mode, the bare
 * fragment in threshold mode.
 *
 * This module is PURE and SYNCHRONOUS: no I/O, no state, no runtime
 * pi imports — S2 consumes it per keystroke and S3's debounce and
 * S4's acceptance tests rely on purity. HapaxConfig is trusted:
 * loadConfig (P1.M3.T1.S1) already validated and clamped it, so no
 * re-validation happens here.
